	/**
	* Assuming parameters from an SB_PlantBed and SB_LiquidContainer component that belong to the same actor,
	* calculate how much liquid to consume from the SB_LiquidContainer and how many feet the plants should grow
	* in the SB_PlantBed for a given frame.
	*
	* This functionality was implemented as a static C++ function rather than a blueprint method of SB_PlantBed
	* because the calculation involves nested if statments that would be unnecessarily difficult to implement
	* using blueprints.
	* 
	* INPUTS:
	*  deltaTime: the time (in seconds) that has elapsed since the previous frame
	*  liquidConsumptionCoeff: the amount of liquid (in gallons) to consume per second
	*  plantGrowthCoeff: the height (in feet) that the plants should grow per second
	*  liquidAvailable: the amount of liquid (in gallons) that the SB_LiquidContainer has
	*  currentPlantHeight: the current height (in feet) of the SB_PlantBed's plants
	*  maxPlantHeight: the maximum allowable height (in feet) of the SB_PlantBed's plants
	*
	* OUTPUTS:
	*  liquidConsumed: the amount of liquid (in gallons) to consume for this frame
	*  plantGrowthAmount: the height (in feet) that the plants should grow for this frame
